- Wazupp, Iâ€™m Malik ðŸ‘‹ !
- I am a mathematician interested in arithmetic geometry and artificial intelligence. 
- My favorite topics are the Sphere Packing problem, the theoretical foundations and understanding of machine learning, the development of a theory of artificial intelligence for mathematical research, the theory of modular forms and elliptic curves, and class field theory. 
- Some of my actual research concerns the use of genetic algorithms such as symbolic classification and symbolic regression for formula generation in order to obtain explicit intuition from machine learning model to guide human intuition for mathematical research. I am also working on the sphere packing problem in dimension 4 where a lattice packing seems to be optimal and where modularity may appear to construct magic functions Ã  la Viazovska. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various projects, from the more applied side of machine learning to medicine to the more abstract side of the above topics.
