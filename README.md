- Wazupp, Iâ€™m Malik ðŸ‘‹ !
- I am a mathematician working at the intersection of number theory, machine learning, and cryptography. 
- My favorite topics are the sphere packing problem, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, the class number problem, post-quantum cryptography, the theoretical foundations and understanding of machine learning, and the development of a theory of artificial intelligence for mathematical research.
- Some of my actual research concerns the use of genetic algorithms such as symbolic classification and symbolic regression for formula generation in order to obtain explicit intuition from machine learning model to guide human intuition for mathematical research. I am also working at the intersection of quantum gravity, sphere packing and dual linear programming bounds for sphere packing in arbitrary dimensions. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various projects, from the more applied side of machine learning to medicine to the more abstract side of the above topics.
