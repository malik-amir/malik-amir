- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Malik !
- I am a mathematician interested in number theory and applications of artificial intelligence to mathematical research. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning / working on category theory, topos theory, algebraic geometry, symbolic classification, mathematical foundations of machine learning 
- and theorem solvers such as LEAN.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various projects, from the more applied side of machine learning to medicine to the more abstract side of the above topics. 
- In particular, I would be curious to see how one could introduce artificial intelligence into LEAN.
